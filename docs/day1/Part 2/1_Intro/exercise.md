# **Introduction**

Open monitoring with Prometheus in Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) refers to the integration of Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit, with Amazon MSK clusters. Prometheus is a popular monitoring solution widely used in the cloud-native ecosystem.

With open monitoring, you can collect metrics and monitor the health and performance of your Kafka clusters. Prometheus, in conjunction with other tools such as Grafana, allows you to gather, store, and analyze various metrics related to your Kafka cluster, such as broker and topic-level statistics, consumer lag, and network throughput.

By following this workshop, you will be able to establish a comprehensive monitoring system for your Amazon MSK cluster and gain valuable insights into its performance and health.
